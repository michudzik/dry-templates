# Dry::Templates [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michudzik/dry-templates.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/michudzik/dry-templates)
The purpose of this gem is to add dry-transaction generators to your rails app.
Generated transactions follow the principle of CRUD, which means that for create, read, update, delete and index actions separate transactions are generated.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dry-templates'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dry-templates

## Usage
Creates transaction for CRUD actions

Example:
<br/>
`$ bin/rails generate dry:templates:transactions init`

This will create:
```
|- app
    |- transactions
        |- application_transaction.rb
```
`$ bin/rails generate dry:templates:transactions users`

This will create:
```
|- app
    |- transactions
        |- application_transaction.rb
        |- users
            |- create.rb
            |- update.rb
            |- fetch.rb
            |- destroy.rb
            |- index.rb
```
`$ bin/rails generate dry:templates:transactions users create update`

This will create:
```
|- app
    |- transactions
        |- application_transaction.rb
        |- users
            |- create.rb
            |- update.rb
```
